## simple regex statistics finder

A super simple regex (regular expressions) function called `statistics_finder.py` that looks for statistics in text. It also removes numbers which aren't statistics (dates for example). This was designed for parsing parliment speech text.

### What it looks for
- Absolute values comprising one moe more digits (e.g. 1, 100, 10000000)
- Uses of Â£, $ and % symbols
- Uses of words such as hundred(s), thousand(s), million(s), billion(s), percent, half and quarter

### What it ignores
- Dates in 01 January 2021 or 01 January format
- The years between 2019 and 2021
- covid19, covid 19 or covid-19
- values followed by months or years
- time values in am and pm format
- values that are preceeded by the words stage, category, No. Vol., c. Ayes or Noes
- certain words like halfterm

### Examples

Actual statistics highlighted in bold we would want to look for. Text comprises many other values that we want to ignore.
